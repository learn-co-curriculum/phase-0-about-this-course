# About This Course

## Welcome

This is the beginning of Flatiron School's Software Engineering and Web
Development Courses. Before we dive into the core topics of these courses, we
need to cover some fundamental topics and make sure you are fully equipped for
success.

First, we need to get your computer (your _local environment_) set up for
writing and running code in JavaScript and Ruby. You'll be running code via a
terminal on your computer, so we'll also go through the basics of the
command-line interface.

After this, we will dive into the technologies behind every modern website:
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You'll start by learning JavaScript programming
fundamentals, followed by the basics of HTML and CSS. With these topics covered,
you'll begin learning how to use the three technologies together to build
websites entirely from scratch.

Finally, we'll introduce Git, GitHub, and the concept of version control,
essential for storing your programming work in this course and beyond.

At the end of the Software Engineering Prep, your final task will be to use all
of your new skills and knowledge to build and publish your own website!
