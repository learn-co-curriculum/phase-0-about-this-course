# About This Course

## Welcome

This is the beginning of Flatiron School's Software Engineering and Web
Development Courses. Before we dive into the core topics of these courses, we
need to cover some fundamental topics and make sure you are fully equipped 
for success.

First, we need to get your computer (your _local environment_) set up for
writing and running code in JavaScript and Ruby. You'll be running code via a
terminal on your computer, so we'll also go through the basics of the
command-line interface.

After this, we'll introduce Git, GitHub and the concept of version control,
essential for storing your programming work in this course and beyond.

With these topics covered, we will dive into the technologies behind every
modern website - HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These three are best understood in
conjunction, so the goal is to introduce just enough of each that you will be
able to use them together. When you can, you'll have all the skills needed to
build a website entirely from scratch.

At the end, your final task is to do just that - build and publish your own
website!
